# Screenshot

* To take a screenshot of the complete computer screen, the algorithm recognises a hand gesture with three fingers
  (specifically, the index finger, thumb finger, and ring finger).

* It utilises the mediapipe Python package and OpenCV.

* The code manages the system devoid of touch inputs.Thus encouraging a hands-free approach.
